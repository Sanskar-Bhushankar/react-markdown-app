## 1. Population

- The **population** includes *all members* of a defined group.
- It represents the *entire set* of items, people, or events that we want to study or analyze.
  
  For example:
  - All students in a school.
  - Every citizen in a country.
  - All cars manufactured by a specific company in a year.

Since studying an entire population can be challenging due to size, time, and cost constraints, we often rely on samples.

## 2. Sample

- A **sample** is a *subset* of the population, chosen to represent the whole group.
- It is used to make inferences or predictions about the population, allowing analysis without examining every member.
  
  For example:
  - A group of students selected from a school to study academic performance.
  - A set of citizens surveyed to gauge public opinion on an issue.
  - A number of cars tested for safety to represent the entire yearâ€™s production.

### Why Use a Sample?
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and resources.
- **Practicality**: Collecting data from a large population can be impractical.
- **Representative Insights**: A well-chosen sample can accurately reflect the characteristics of the entire population.
