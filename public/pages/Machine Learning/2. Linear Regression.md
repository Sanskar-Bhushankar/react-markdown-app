## Fitting a line 

1. **Linear Regression Basics**:
   - Linear regression finds a straight line that best represents the relationship between two variables in your data (e.g., study time vs. test scores).

2. **Fitting a Line**:
   - The goal is to draw a line that is as close as possible to all the data points, showing the trend clearly.

3. **Residuals and Their Squares**:
   - **Residuals** are the distances between the actual data points and the line. To avoid negative values, we **square** these distances, leading to the **sum of squared residuals**. A lower sum means a better fit.

4. **Least Squares Method**:
   - The **least squares** method adjusts the line's slope and intercept to minimize the sum of squared residuals, finding the best-fitting line.

5. **Finding the Best Fit**:
   - Calculus is used to determine where the slope of the sum of squared residuals is zero, indicating the optimal line that best fits the data. 

In short, linear regression helps us model and understand relationships in data by fitting a line that minimizes errors.
