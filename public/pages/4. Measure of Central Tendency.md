A **Measure of Central Tendency** is a value that represents the center or "typical" value of a dataset. It helps summarize data by identifying a single value that characterizes the entire dataset.

## 3 Types of Measure of Central Tendency:
1. **Mean:** The average of all data points.
2. **Median:** The middle value when data is arranged in ascending or descending order.
3. **Mode:** The most frequent value in the dataset.

---

## 1. Mean: Population Mean vs. Sample Mean

### 1.1 Population Mean (μ)
- **Definition:** The average of all values in the entire population.
- **Formula:**
  $$
  \mu = \frac{\sum X}{N}
  $$
  Where:
    - \( X \) = Each individual value in the population.
    - \( N \) = Total number of values in the population.

- **Example:**  
    If the population consists of the heights (in cm) of 5 people: 160, 165, 170, 175, 180.

    Population mean (μ):
    $$
    \mu = \frac{160 + 165 + 170 + 175 + 180}{5} = 170 \, \text{cm}
    $$

### 1.2 Sample Mean (x̄)
- **Definition:** The average of values in a sample (a subset of the population).
- **Formula:**
  $$
  \bar{x} = \frac{\sum X}{n}
  $$
  Where:
    - \( X \) = Each individual value in the sample.
    - \( n \) = Number of values in the sample.

- **Example:**  
    If you take a sample of 3 heights: 160, 170, 180.

    Sample mean (x̄):
    $$
    \bar{x} = \frac{160 + 170 + 180}{3} = 170 \, \text{cm}
    $$

# 2. Median

The **Median** is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is useful as a measure of central tendency, especially when the data contains outliers, as it is less affected by extreme values than the mean.

## Key Points:
- **Odd Number of Values:** If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.
- **Even Number of Values:** If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### Calculation of Median

1. **Odd Number of Values**

    - **Example:**  
      Dataset: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
      
      - Ordered: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
      - Median: **7** (the middle value)

2. **Even Number of Values**

    - **Example:**  
      Dataset: 4, 8, 15, 16
      
      - Ordered: 4, 8, 15, 16
      - Median:
      $$
      \text{Median} = \frac{8 + 15}{2} = 11.5
      $$
      (average of the two middle values)

# 3. Mode

The **Mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, multiple modes, or no mode at all.
## Key Characteristics of Mode

1. **Unimodal:** If there is only one mode.
2. **Bimodal:** If there are two modes.
3. **Multimodal:** If there are more than two modes.
4. **No Mode:** If no value repeats in the dataset.

## Purpose of Mode
The mode is helpful for identifying the **most common value** in a dataset, which is valuable in fields such as marketing, psychology, and quality control to understand what is typical or popular.

### Examples of Mode Types

- **Unimodal**  
  Dataset: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4  
  Mode: **2** (appears most frequently)

- **Bimodal**  
  Dataset: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4  
  Modes: **2** and **3** (both appear twice)

- **Multimodal**  
  Dataset: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3  
  Modes: **1, 2, and 3** (each appears twice)

- **No Mode**  
  Dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
  Mode: **No mode** (each value appears only once)

### Special Case Example

- Dataset: 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3  
  Mode: **Unimodal - 3**  
  Since **3** has the highest frequency (3 times), it is the single mode despite other values appearing more than once.

## Mode with Categorical Data

- **Nominal Data Example**  
  Dataset: "Red", "Blue", "Blue", "Green", "Red", "Red"  
  Mode: **"Red"** (occurs three times)

- **Ordinal Data Example**  
  Dataset: "Low", "Medium", "Medium", "High", "High", "High"  
  Mode: **"High"** (occurs three times)

- **No Mode in Categorical Data**  
  Dataset: "Cat", "Dog", "Bird"  
  Mode: **No mode** (each category appears only once)

# 5. Weighted Mean

The **Weighted Mean** is a type of average that accounts for the **importance (weight)** of each value in a dataset. Unlike the regular mean, which treats all values equally, the weighted mean gives more influence to certain values based on their assigned weights.

## Formula

The weighted mean is calculated as:

$$
\text{Weighted Mean} = \frac{\sum (X_i \times W_i)}{\sum W_i}
$$

Where:

- \( Xi \) = Each value in the dataset
- \( Wi \) = The weight assigned to each value
- The **numerator** sums the product of each value and its weight
- The **denominator** sums all the weights


## Purpose

The weighted mean is useful in situations where some values are more significant than others, such as in **finance**, **education**, and **statistics**.

---

## Example

Suppose you have the following grades for a course, along with their respective weights (credit hours):

- **Grades:**
    - Exam 1: 80 (weight = 3)
    - Exam 2: 90 (weight = 4)
    - Exam 3: 70 (weight = 2)

### Calculating the Weighted Mean

1. **Multiply each grade by its weight:**
    - Exam 1: \( 80 \* 3 = 240 \)
    - Exam 2: \( 90 \* 4 = 360 \)
    - Exam 3: \( 70 \* 2 = 140 \)

2. **Sum the weighted grades:**
   $$
   240 + 360 + 140 = 740
   $$

3. **Sum the weights:**
   $$
   3 + 4 + 2 = 9
   $$

4. **Calculate the weighted mean:**
   $$
   \text{Weighted Mean} = \frac{740}{9} \approx 82.22
   $$

# 6. Trimmed Mean

The **Trimmed Mean** is an average that removes a certain percentage of the highest and lowest values from a dataset before calculating the mean. This approach reduces the influence of **outliers** or **extreme values**, providing a more robust measure of central tendency.

## Steps to Calculate the Trimmed Mean

1. **Determine** the percentage of data to trim from both ends of the dataset (e.g., 5% or 10%).
2. **Remove** the specified percentage of the lowest and highest values.
3. **Calculate** the mean of the remaining values.
## Purpose

The trimmed mean is particularly useful in datasets with **outliers** or **skewed distributions**, as it provides a better representation of the "central" value of the data without being affected by extreme values.

## Formula

There isn’t a specific formula for the trimmed mean, but the calculation can be summarized as:

$$
\text{Trimmed Mean} = \frac{\sum \text{(Remaining values after trimming)}}{\text{Number of remaining values}}
$$


## Example

Suppose you have the following dataset of exam scores:

**Dataset:** 55, 60, 62, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 100

1. **Trim Percentage:** Let's say we want to trim 10% from each end.
   - 10% of 10 values = 1 value from each end.

2. **Trimmed Dataset:**
   - Remove the lowest value (55) and the highest value (100).
   - Remaining scores: 60, 62, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90

3. **Calculate the Trimmed Mean:**
   $$
   \text{Trimmed Mean} = \frac{60 + 62 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90}{8} = \frac{682}{8} = 85.25
   $$
